# Machine-Learning-Projects

This repository contains the code for my projects developed as part of the "Machine Learning" exam within the Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Master's course at Sapienza University.

## [First Homework: Regression ](./1st%20project%20(regression))

This assignment addresses the problem of computing the forward kinematics of robots using machine
learning models, focusing on three different robot configurations: a 2-joint planar, a 3-joint planar
and a 5-joint 3D robot. The goal is to predict the position and orientation of the robot’s end-effector
based on the joint angles. Three different datasets are used, each corresponding to one of the robot
configurations.
 
## [Second Homework: Classification](./2nd%20project%20(classification))
The second task involved the classification of various actions a car could perform, given as input an image of the vehicle engaged in a track circuit. To accomplish this objective, a range of techniques was employed, resulting in the creation of two distinct models. These models were then subjected to a comparative analysis to assess their efficacy in addressing the task.
